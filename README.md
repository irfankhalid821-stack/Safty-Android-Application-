🚨 Firebase Safety App


Women Protection & Emergency Response System

📌 Overview


The Firebase Safety App is an Android-based emergency response system designed to enhance personal safety by enabling users to send real-time alerts and location data during critical situations.
The application leverages Firebase Realtime Database, GPS tracking, and Google Maps API to provide a fast, reliable, and scalable safety solution.
