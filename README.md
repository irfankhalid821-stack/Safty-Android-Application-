🚨 Firebase Safety App
Women Protection & Emergency Response System

📌 Overview
The Firebase Safety App is an Android-based emergency response system designed to enhance personal safety by enabling users to send real-time alerts and location data during critical situations.
The application leverages Firebase Realtime Database, GPS tracking, and Google Maps API to provide a fast, reliable, and scalable safety solution.

🎯 Problem Statement
With the rise in safety threats such as harassment, kidnapping, robbery, and other emergencies, there is a critical need for a system that can:
